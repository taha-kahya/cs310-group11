# LocAI

## Project Description  
LocAI is a mobile app that helps users find places more naturally by allowing them to type queries in everyday language. Instead of relying on fixed filters, the app converts user input into structured Google Maps API parameters (such as place type, keyword, radius, or open status) and returns the most relevant results. The results are displayed as a simple list with key details like name, rating, and address, and users can open the selected place directly in the Google Maps app for directions.  

Firebase is used to store user favorites, search history, and preferences, making the experience more personal over time.
